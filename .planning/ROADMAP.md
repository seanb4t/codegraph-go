# Roadmap: CodeGraph Go

## Overview

CodeGraph Go is a ground-up Go rewrite of TypeScript CodeGraph — a drop-in, TS-v1.3.x-parity replacement in a single static binary. **v0.1 (Initial Release) shipped 2026-07-14**: the core capabilities (indexing, query, MCP server, sync, migration) work from a signed/attested/SBOM'd release that beats TS 1.3.1 on every measured benchmark — but the CLI/agent surface still diverged *behaviorally* from TS. **v1.0 (Drop-in Parity & Human UX) shipped 2026-08-03**: those gaps are closed. An existing user can now swap binaries with zero change in experience — TS-identical `explore`/`node`/`status` behavior, watcher-on-MCP by default, git/worktree awareness, output hygiene, a human-facing Charm TUI behind a build-enforced rendering seam (the agent/MCP path never sees ANSI), systematic flag reconciliation, fully automated signed releases via release-please + GoReleaser, and contributor-facing local build tooling. **v0.3.0 (MCP Protocol Currency) shipped 2026-08-06**: the stdio MCP server is current with spec revision `2026-07-28` on `modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk@v1.7.0`, proven by a wire-level oracle that never imports the SDK it tests, with every Legacy client still working.

**v0.5.0 (macOS Distribution & Homebrew) shipped 2026-08-11.** The binary is now *installable by convention* on macOS. `spctl -a -vv -t exec` returns **accepted** on both darwin arches, and `brew tap seanb4t/tap && brew install codegraph` works on a clean machine. The release pipeline moved onto a single `goreleaser release` invocation — whose `notarize:` and `homebrew_casks:` blocks never execute under the `goreleaser build --single-target` matrix the pipeline had always used — with both Linux legs `zig cc` cross-compiled from one macOS runner. That cross-compilation was the milestone's single unproven claim; it was spiked first, blocking, and **passed on variation V1 at first dispatch**, so the costed GoReleaser Pro fallback was never bought. `codegraph upgrade` now detects a Homebrew-managed install and steps aside rather than mutating a Caskroom the package manager owns.

**Versioning note:** "v1.0" is a *planning-milestone* name, never a release version. The shipped artifact line reached `v0.2.0` at v1.0's close and has since advanced through `v0.3.0`, `v0.4.0` and — across v0.5.0 — `v0.5.0` … `v0.9.0`, each computed by release-please from Conventional Commits; there is deliberately no `v1.0.0` tag (maintainer directive D-06R, 2026-07-29). Milestone labels track the release line but carry **no git tag**: release-please remains the sole tag authority, pinned by `TestGsdTagCreationIsDisabled`. A hand-created `v*` tag would additionally match `release.yml`'s `push: tags: "v[0-9]*"` trigger and falsely fire the release pipeline. The milestone record lives in `MILESTONES.md` + `milestones/`. (`milestone-v0.1` exists only because it predates release-please.)

## Milestones

- ✅ **v0.1 — Initial Release** — Phases 1–8 (shipped 2026-07-14) — core capabilities + signed release; not yet a drop-in parity replacement
- ✅ **v1.0 — Drop-in Parity & Human UX** — Phases 1–10 (shipped 2026-08-03) — behavioral + surface parity with TS 1.3.1, human TUI, automated signed releases, local build tooling
- ✅ **v0.3.0 — MCP Protocol Currency** — Phases 1–5 (shipped 2026-08-06) — official Go SDK adoption, `2026-07-28` spec compliance without breaking Legacy clients, a wire-level verification oracle, tool-modfile vulnerability coverage
- ✅ **v0.5.0 — macOS Distribution & Homebrew** — Phases 1–4 (shipped 2026-08-11) — `goreleaser release` migration with zig cross-compilation, Apple notarization, a Homebrew tap and cask, and an `upgrade` that steps aside under brew. Promoted backlog 999.5, consumed SEED-002. Full detail: [`milestones/v0.5.0-ROADMAP.md`](./milestones/v0.5.0-ROADMAP.md)
- 📋 **Later** — unscoped. Candidates: the Backlog items below (999.2 tmux TTY harness, 999.4 CheckRegression guard), the v0.5.x deferrals (DIST-06 stapled offline-safe container, BREW-07 homebrew-core), Team Scale (central server, CI-distributed indexes), MRTR/elicitation (MRTR-01), annotations (embeddings/communities/export), local Svelte web UI (SEED-001)

## Backlog

### Phase 999.2: tmux e2e/UAT test harness and suite (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** [Captured for future planning] A real-PTY end-to-end test harness that drives the interactive TUI through **tmux** (send-keys + capture-pane) so the terminal actually replies to escape queries and actually scrolls — the exact conditions the current piped/non-TTY suite can never reproduce. Motivation: v1.0 Phase 7's human UAT caught two user-visible TUI bugs that BOTH the full piped automated suite AND a deep multi-agent code review missed, because they only manifest on a live TTY — G-07-1 (bare `daemon` on a TTY with an empty registry leaked the terminal's DECRQM capability-probe responses `^[[?2026;2$y^[[?2027;0$y`) and G-07-2 (both bubbletea pickers rendered inline without alt-screen → heavy flicker + blank list). bubbletea Models are unit-testable via synthetic `tea.Msg` (state transitions) but that path never renders. Scope a suite that spawns the release binary inside a tmux pane and asserts on `capture-pane` output: (a) bare `daemon` empty-registry prints ONLY `no running daemons` with no leaked escape sequences; (b) the daemon picker enters the alternate screen, renders `Running daemons` + a seeded record, and restores the main buffer on quit (no residual escapes in scrollback); (c) the install/uninstall checkbox picker renders `[x]`/`[ ]` glyphs, `space` toggles, `q`/`esc` cancels with zero config writes; (d) no flicker proxy (stable capture across N frames). Reuse the `tmux` skill's send-keys/capture-pane idioms; gate the suite behind a build tag / CI job that has tmux available (skip cleanly where it isn't). This is the missing rung between the piped never-hang/byte-identity integration tests (necessary, TTY-blind) and manual human UAT (thorough, unautomated).

### Phase 999.4: CheckRegression current-metrics positivity guard (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** [Captured for future planning] Close the degenerate-input bypass in `internal/bench.CheckRegression`, surfaced and **reproduced** during the Phase 10 security audit (recorded in `10-SECURITY.md` → "Advisory — Unregistered Surface"; also code-review finding WR-06). Calling `CheckRegression(baseline, current, ceiling=1)` with `current.PeakRSSBytes = 0` and an otherwise-matching frame returns `nil` — **both** the relative RSS regression check and the absolute INDX-06 memory ceiling silently pass. The function already validates that the *baseline* metrics are positive; it never validates the *current* ones, so a zero or negative current reading reads as "no regression" instead of "unusable measurement". This is unreachable through today's only caller because `internal/bench.PeakRSSBytes` returns an error rather than a zero on failure, but `CheckRegression` is exported, its doc comment claims it "never misleads", and the phase-10 audit already showed how easily a frame-descriptor blind spot becomes a live gate failure. Scope: add a positivity/sanity check on `current` mirroring the existing baseline check, refusing rather than passing on a non-positive throughput or RSS reading, with an error naming which field was degenerate. This belongs to the repo's documented class of **gates that cannot fire** (the retracted 10.6% perf claim, the inverted `rg -qv` gate, the 51.5%-stale baseline) — so the fix must be demonstrated RED with a degenerate-input test, not merely added.
