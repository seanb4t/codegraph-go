# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-10)

**Core value:** An agent user can uninstall TS CodeGraph, install the Go binary, migrate their indexes, and everything works the same or better — faster, from a single verifiably-built binary.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Foundation — Storage, Schema & Parser Strategy

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Foundation — Storage, Schema & Parser Strategy) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 7
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-07-10 — Phase 01 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Parser strategy (CGo tree-sitter vs wazero WASM) resolved by a benchmarked spike in Phase 1 before architecture locks
- [Roadmap]: Golden-output corpus + TS schema DDL captured in Phase 1 (while live TS version is available) to measure MCP parity against ground truth
- [Roadmap]: Migration tool (Phase 7) waits on Phase 2 schema stability; interface-dispatch synthesis + provenance land with language breadth in Phase 5
- [Phase 01]: Used github.com/cockroachdb/pebble/v2 (not deprecated bare v1 path) per RESEARCH Pitfall 4
- [Phase 01]: Did not run go mod tidy in 01-01 — deps pinned but unimported until Wave 2 code lands

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Parser strategy is unresolved until the Phase 1 spike; it gates static-build guarantees (DIST) and the CGo dependency exception (DIST-05)
