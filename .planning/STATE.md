# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-10)

**Core value:** An agent user can uninstall TS CodeGraph, install the Go binary, migrate their indexes, and everything works the same or better — faster, from a single verifiably-built binary.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation (Storage, Schema & Parser Strategy)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Foundation — Storage, Schema & Parser Strategy)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-10 — Roadmap created (8 phases, 51/51 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Parser strategy (CGo tree-sitter vs wazero WASM) resolved by a benchmarked spike in Phase 1 before architecture locks
- [Roadmap]: Golden-output corpus + TS schema DDL captured in Phase 1 (while live TS version is available) to measure MCP parity against ground truth
- [Roadmap]: Migration tool (Phase 7) waits on Phase 2 schema stability; interface-dispatch synthesis + provenance land with language breadth in Phase 5

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Parser strategy is unresolved until the Phase 1 spike; it gates static-build guarantees (DIST) and the CGo dependency exception (DIST-05)
